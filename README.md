Smart Irrigation System 🌱💧

This project uses machine learning to build a Smart Irrigation System that predicts water requirements based on sensor data. It helps conserve water and ensure optimal irrigation for crops.


---

🚀 Features

Uses real-time sensor data to predict irrigation needs.

Machine Learning models like Random Forest and MultiOutputClassifier.

Visual analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Scalable and adaptable for smart farming solutions.
